# Clean Code ✨

A repository dedicated to share Clean Code Hints 


## What is Clean Code? ♻️

It is a software development philosophy that consists in applying techniques that make the code more…

✅ Clear
✅ Intuitive
✅ Reliable
✅ Understandable
✅ Easy to read
✅ Easy to modify
✅ Easy to review
✅ Easy to maintain
✅ Reusable
✅ Maintanable
✅ Less susceptible to technical debts (TDs)
✅ Less susceptible bugs


## Where did Clean Code originate? 📘

## Some signs that the code is dirty 💩

**Rigidity**: No change is trivial; each change in the code adds more twists and tangles.

**Complexity**: Changes require a lot of research for understanding and implementation.

**Fragility**: Changes break existing parts of the code.

**Immobility**: You can't reuse existing parts of the code.


### Rigidity

It's when you have a system that displays the user's name on the screen, and you're going to implement the code that shows the surname, but you had to change the code that shows the age, nationality, CPF, the one that calculates the next prime number, and the one that discovers the cure for cancer.

## How can I clean my code? 🧹

1. DRY
2. KISS
3. YAGNI
4. SRP
5. Avoid IFs Hadouken 
6. Avoid Negative Conditionals
7. Avoid Flag Arguments
8. Avoid Comments
9. Good Nomenclatures
10. Use Vertical Formatting
11. Delete Code > Create Code
12. Boy Scout Rule

### DRY

**Don't Repeat Yourself**

If a piece of code is identical or very similar to another, try to extract it into a generalized function (parameters are your friends).
